1. Somewhat. Arrays are pretty tricky and there are a lot of ways you can go astray. I understand the basics but there is a lot to keep track of. 

2. I just need more reps with arrays. Nothing in particular was too troublesome but they are the most challenging element as a whole for me thus far. 

3. When you pop or shift, I assume the index values change? For example, When you pop item 1, item 2 now moves to index 0? I am just curious if this can cause problems if you have a condition that is dependent upon a certain value in an array. I would guess if that scenario arises, an array wasn't the best option in the first place. 

Also, I am having a hard time finding a use for boolean arrays.
